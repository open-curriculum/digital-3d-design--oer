# 3D Modeling Project

For this project, you will model a low poly animal using open source 3D design software called Blender, available for [download here](https://www.blender.org/).

**Deliverables:**

1. Rendered image of low poly model: 1920x1080px 
2. Photoshop wireframe wallpaper pattern: 1920x1080px
3. Link to realtime [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bird-982fd7195bf34bc3884e06c26aba167d) hosted model

## Steps to completion

1. Watch the Blender Foundation videos 1-15 to get acquainted with the interface and modeling tools.
2. Choose an animal to model. Find animal reference images. Bring the reference image into Blender to model from.
3. Begin modeling your object.
   1. Practice editing vertices, edges, and faces.
   2. Use the Loop Cut and Extrude tools to add geometry to the mesh.
4. Be mindful to create tidy [edge flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lip59doQQRk) to ensure a well-crafted mesh topology.
5. Add materials and assign to selected faces of the model.
6. Set up lights and camera
7. Once the composition is the way you want it, render the image.
8. Upload the .blend file to SketchFab and configure the 3D scene in SketchFab.
9. Render a wireframe version of the model.
   * Duplicate the model and hide the original.
   * Create a new material with surface set to "holdout." This will create a matte black color. Apply this to the duplicate.
   * Add the wireframe modifier and configure the thickness of the wireframe.
   * Render the image and save it.
10. Create a graphic design or pattern incorporating the wireframe rendering in Photoshop and save the image.

## Grading Rubric

* Steps to completion were followed: 40%
* Craft: 40%
  * Model has a low polygon count, in the "low poly" modeling style

  * Model is made from 4-sided polygons, and has evenly spaced polygon geometry.
  * Model is appropriate scale in Blender scene
  * Renders and Photoshop compositions are well considered.
* On-time submission: 20%
