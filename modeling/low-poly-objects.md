# 3D Modeling Project

For this project, you will model a low poly animal using open source 3D design software called Blender, available for [download here](https://www.blender.org/).



Deliverables:

1. Rendered image of low poly model: 1920x1080px 
2. Photoshop wireframe wallpaper pattern: 1920x1080px
3. Link to realtime [SketchFab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/bird-982fd7195bf34bc3884e06c26aba167d) hosted model

## Steps to completion

1. Watch the Blender Foundation videos 1-15 to get acquainted with the interface and modeling tools.
2. Choose an animal to model. Find animal reference images. Bring the reference image into Blender to model from.
3. Begin modeling your object.
   1. Practice editing vertices, edges, and faces.
   2. Use the Loop Cut and Extrude tools to add geometry to the mesh.
4. Be mindful to create tidy [edge flow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lip59doQQRk) to ensure a well-crafted mesh topology.
5. Add materials and assign to selected faces of the model.

## Grading Rubric

* Craft: 40%
  * Model has good edge flow
  * Model is made from 4-sided polygons
  * Model is appropriate scale in Blender scene
* On-time submission: 20%
